# App Custom Lints

A collection of custom lint rules for Flutter/Dart projects, focusing on enforcing best practices and code quality. Currently includes a powerful rule to detect and prevent hardcoded strings in Flutter widgets.

## Features

- üîç **No Hardcoded Strings Rule**: Detects and warns against string literals in Text widgets
- üåç **Internationalization Support**: Enforces proper i18n practices
- üöÄ **Easy Integration**: Simple setup with custom_lint
- ‚ö° **Performance**: Minimal impact on analysis time

## Installation

Add the package to your `pubspec.yaml` in the `dev_dependencies` section:

```yaml
dev_dependencies:
  custom_lint: ^latest_version
  app_custom_lints:
    git:
      url: https://github.com/AlexxyQQ/custom_lints.git
      ref: main # or specify a commit hash/tag
```

Then run:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

Create or update your `analysis_options.yaml`:

```yaml
analyzer:
  plugins:
    - custom_lint
```

## Available Rules

### avoid_string_literals_inside_widget

Detects hardcoded string literals inside Flutter widgets to enforce proper internationalization practices.

#### ‚ùå What it catches:

```dart
// These will trigger the lint
Text('Hello World');
Text(data: 'Welcome User');
```

#### ‚úÖ Correct usage:

Using Easy Localization:

```dart
// 1. Define keys in locale_keys.g.dart
abstract class LocaleKeys {
  static const hello_world = 'hello_world';
}

// 2. Add translations in assets/translations/en.json
{
  "hello_world": "Hello World"
}

// 3. Use in your code
Text(LocaleKeys.hello_world.tr());
```

Using Flutter gen-l10n:

```dart
// In your ARB files (app_en.arb)
{
  "helloWorld": "Hello World"
}

// In your code
Text(AppLocalizations.of(context)!.helloWorld);
```

## Rule Configuration

The rules can be configured in your `analysis_options.yaml`:

```yaml
custom_lint:
  rules:
    - avoid_string_literals_inside_widget:
        severity: error # or warning
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use localization keys instead of hardcoded strings
2. Keep translation files organized and up-to-date
3. Use code generation tools for managing localization keys
4. Consider using enums for string comparisons instead of hardcoded strings
